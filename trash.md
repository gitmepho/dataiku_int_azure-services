## OPTIONAL - Come back to resolve as bonus
- To start dataikiu as a system-managed service, stop the instance `/home/khun/DATA_DIR/bin/dss stop`. Create a system service using install-boot script `sudo "/home/khun/INSTALL_DIR/dataiku-dss-12.2.3/scripts/install/install-boot.sh" "/home/khun/DATA_DIR" dataiku` and start the system service `sudo systemctl start dataiku`.

Ran into some issue starting the systemctl service: 

```
sudo systemctl start dataiku

Job for dataiku.service failed because the control process exited with error code. See "systemctl status dataiku.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.

sudo systemctl status dataiku.service

To save time, I will come back to this issue at the at the later time.
